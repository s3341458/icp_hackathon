i# Smart Contract for Price Assurance in Digital Currency Shopping

## Overview
This project presents a smart contract (canister) written in Motoko, designed for use in digital currency shopping scenarios. The primary aim is to alleviate the common concern among consumers regarding potential future price drops or currency value appreciation. By implementing this smart contract, we guarantee that if the price of a product is lowered after a purchase, the difference will be refunded to the buyer. This mechanism is intended to encourage more immediate and confident purchasing decisions.

## Features
